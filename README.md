This project is for the final project of CS 498 Data Visualization course from University of Illinois Urbana Champaign.

## Message
I tried to deliver trends in data science from 2020 to 2022. I utilized survey data that aggregated salary information from people who work in the data science field all around the world. My dashboard consists of two charts. One is the top 10 salary job titles, which allows users to navigate which job title came into the spotlight each year. The other shows a histogram chart that helps users see how many people receive how much salary in that year. The bubble chart shows that the trends in data science have moved from ‘machine learning(2020)’ to ‘AI or Analytics(2022)’. The bar chart, which has annotations, shows that the salary level has continuously increased from 2020 to 2022.

The dashboard follows an 'interactive slide show' because the dashboard allows users to select and explore at all steps of the story. The dashboard shows the very past data from the beginning by default. This means that it allows users can freely navigate the next scenes or explore further by selecting different parameters.
